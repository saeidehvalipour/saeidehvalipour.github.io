I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at University of Delaware, advised by Professors [Ilya Safro](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~isafro/). My interests lie in Hypothesis Generation via Generative-AI, Large Language Model and Graph in Big Data.

Earlier, I have worked for almost a decade in R&D in two deffirent doman of telecom and automative industry. During my journey in Automative industry collaborating with Data transformation on Volvo Cloud in Over The Air (OTA) product, I followed my passion in understanding how AI impacts our world, I began a Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Delaware. This sparked my decision to go back to academia and do research on Large Language Model and AI collaboration.

I also have prior industry experience as a Software Developer and Automation Expert.

## Current Projects

The main project I am working on is exploring explainability and interpretability in hypothesis generation with Large Language Models. 


The second project I am currently working on is 

## Past Projects

I have researched on “Language-independent Detector for Auto-Generated Tweets (AGT)” was an LNU-funded research project on Nordic Tweet Stream (NTS) dataset that included two significant contributions to the field.
